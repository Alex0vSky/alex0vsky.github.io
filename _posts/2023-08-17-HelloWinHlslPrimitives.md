Using [__HelloWinHlsl__](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlsl/) to draw primitives with shaders in available version of DirectX

I‚Äôll explain why a separate section is dedicated to such a simple topic.
I remember that this was not an easy task, as it seemed at first.
Which is quite strange for **3D**, because everything there consists of so-called *primitives*.
I'm guessing that the desire to draw primitives for a newbie/beginner would come first.
After all, all textbooks and manuals on ordinary *3D* begin with this.
Now I‚Äôll describe what difficulties I encountered so that you don‚Äôt have to üòä

And to be honest, the first working shader was obtained for [ball](/posts/HelloWinHlslBall/),
after all, the goal of my study of shaders was the simulation/emulation/visualization of physical processes from particles.
But there's a good chance you'll start with primitives.

## Introduction to the topic
Right off the bat! R&D.
Just a test **poc** project with minimal code containing a shader for DirectX.
Just to understand how the minimum works.
Let's see, the first thing we came across was Hello World: ‚ÄúDirect3D 10 Hello World‚Äù
[https://gist.github.com/Overv/3989887](https://gist.github.com/Overv/3989887)

There is a version of the *API* platform *DirectX10/Dx10Direct3D* or simply *Dx10*.
> Make sure we support this version of the *API* using this tool:
[DxCapsViewer](https://github.com/microsoft/DxCapsViewer). Can be taken from this repository.
Or perhaps you already have this file `dxcapsviewer.exe`{: .filepath} in *WDK*.
If this is not supported, then there is nothing wrong with training,
the compiled/built application will be launched in emulation mode:
*WARP* will emulate a *GPU* using a *CPU* and it will be quite slow.

We will implement the solution in the studio, I had *MSVC2019*.
Let's edit the *functions* a little, move `if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)break;` inside the loop `while (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))`,
so closing the application exists in reality.
Everything is working. From the code you can see that the shader is drawn on the polygon.

Additional checks.
If you have *NVIDIA* and the corresponding option is enabled,
then, working in the system tray (where the clock is), you will see that the example works on the *NVIDIA* adapter.
In the *procexp* tool, when viewing a process in the GPU tab, under GPU Allocation, the graph is not empty.
This means that everything works on the correct graphics adapter, a fast one.

We change the coordinates of the vertices, the picture changes.
We change the colors of the *RGB* shader, the picture changes.
So, **poc** is complete.
You can move on and develop a solution.

### First steps
Naturally, we understand that shaders work, but this is certainly not enough.
We need something beautiful.
When you're quickly searching for shader topics, **shadertoy.com** might catch your eye, it has a ton of great code examples.

#### The shadertoy.com
If anyone doesn't already know, this is a portal where the community publishes examples of their **GLSL** code.
Which can be launched online immediately: [shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

He also has his own system, I would say API, which gives access to the required timer.
Well, access to the mouse allows you to rotate the scene. There's a lot more there.

Searching on the portal is convenient. Registration is simple.
You can read and leave comments.
There is code highlighting. Display error messages.
I can write a lot about this wonderful portal. There are mountains of information there!

There is also [glslsandbox.com](https://glslsandbox.com/).
It is convenient to view changes in the shader made by the community over time. I haven't used it much, I don't know why.

#### Other, stay determined
Here's something that's easy to compile/build and might inspire you to take further steps if you've lost your resolve.
- In my opinion, the example with a particle system from the examples *directx-sdk-samples* is called
[NBodyGravityCS11](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples/tree/main/NBodyGravityCS11) looks exciting.
The example was kindly posted in the repository, and the repository is kindly maintained by *Chuck Walborn*;
- Also don't ignore the excellent examples from [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx),
There are many of them and the particle system there is also beautiful.
The project is easy to compile/build, but difficult to understand its architecture and its own shader language.

## Forward movement
If there is inspiration, then we continue the search.
I got lucky and found this shader: [Necromurloc - Basic 2D primitive](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tlXXzs).
Credits: "Created by [Necromurlok](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Necromurlok) July 24, 2019."
It has almost everything you need, albeit in **GLSL**.

Well, almost everything is ready,
now you need/can usefully spend your time watching
beautiful and voluminous lesson [thebookofshaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)
convert **GLSL** to **HLSL**.
The cross-platform tool [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed) may be useful.
Run **GLSL** and **HLSL** shaders in real time, as well as instant recompilation and re-running.
It turns out that the shader always shows its work in real time from the current code.
There is also a **GLSL** and **HLSL** shader debugger.

Getting it to work turns out to be easy; Here are a few notes about things that are not obvious.
- In **GLSL** you can use shorthand notations, and `vec2(0.5)` is the same as `vec2(0.5,0.5)`
- In **HLSL** the system/keywords/registered words are not the same as in **GLSL**,
for example, the word "line" is a "preprocessor directive" in **HLSL**.

From theoretical knowledge, the term **SDF**=Signed Distance Fields is useful.
and these tutorials [ronja](https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/post/034-2d-sdf-basics/)

You can take a walk around the portal [shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
and reading community comments can be helpful.

Here is the link that remained after searching, but it turned out to be not so useful:

If you need additional shader code or your own special one with blackjack,
then you can look at [shaderc](https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/tools.html#shader-compiler-shaderc).
This was invented on [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx). I can't comment, I didn't spend enough time on **shaderc**.

And yes, the topic of shader compilation and, for example, *DirectXShaderCompiler/DXC* are not touched upon here.

So below you can see the results.
At the same time, the entry point `main` is not presented, because this post turned out to be big anyway,
secondly, in addition to the `uv` transformation, there are simply function calls.
Everything can be viewed in the repo, for example for
[Dx9](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx9.hlsl#L65)

### Rectangle
Was `float` became `float1`.
Was `vec2` became `float2`.
Was `vec2(0.0)` became `float2(0.0, 0.0)`.
```hlsl
float1 rectangle(in float2 uv, in float2 size2, in float2 off) {
	float2 d = step(abs(uv - off) - size2, float2(0.0, 0.0));
	return d.x * d.y;
}
```
For all versions of *Dx* everything is the same, only for *Dx9* the old format there is a constant for screen sizes:
[Dx9](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx9.hlsl#L5)
, [Dx10](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx10.hlsl#L6)
, [Dx11](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx11.hlsl#L6)
, [Dx12](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx12.hlsl#L6)

### Square
Was `float` became `float1`.
Was `vec2` became `float2`.
Was `vec2(0.0)` became `float2(0.0, 0.0)`.
```hlsl
float1 quad(in float2 uv, float1 size1, in float2 off) {
	float2 d = step(abs(uv - off) - size1, float2(0.0, 0.0));
	return d.x * d.y;
}
```
For all versions of *Dx* everything is the same, only for *Dx9* the old format there is a constant for screen sizes:
[Dx9](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx9.hlsl#L10)
, [Dx10](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx10.hlsl#L11)
, [Dx11](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx11.hlsl#L11)
, [Dx12](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx12.hlsl#L11)

### Circle
Was `float` became `float1`.
Was `vec2` became `float2`.
```hlsl
float1 circle(in float2 uv, float1 radius, in float2 off) {
	float2 d = off - uv;
	return step(dot(d, d), radius * radius);
}
```
For all versions of *Dx* everything is the same, only for *Dx9* the old format there is a constant for screen sizes:
[Dx9](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx9.hlsl#L15)
, [Dx10](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx10.hlsl#L16)
, [Dx11](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx11.hlsl#L16)
, [Dx12](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx12.hlsl#L16)

### Line
Was `float` became `float1`.
Was `vec2` became `float2`.
It's interesting that a simple line requires a lot of code.
```hlsl
float1 line_(float2 uv, float2 p0, float2 p1, float1 pointSize) {
	float2 line__ = p1 - p0;
	float2 dir = uv - p0;

	pointSize *= pointSize;

	float1 h = clamp(dot(dir, line__) / dot(line__, line__), 0.0, 1.0);
	dir -= line__ * h;

	return step(dot(dir, dir) - pointSize, pointSize);
}
```
For all versions of *Dx* everything is the same, only for *Dx9* the old format there is a constant for screen sizes:
[Dx9](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx9.hlsl#L20)
, [Dx10](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx10.hlsl#L21)
, [Dx11](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx11.hlsl#L21)
, [Dx12](https://github.com/Alex0vSky/HelloWinHlslPrimitives/blob/main/resource/primitives_ps_Dx12.hlsl#L21)

## Roadmap/Todo
Measure the output performance of each primitive.

## Manual for converting from GLSL to HLSL
This will be quite enough, we will use it as a reference:
