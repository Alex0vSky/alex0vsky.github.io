## TinyEHCI
Tiny, less than 512 bytes, bare metal EHCI read
`step5_gh/bootsector.asm`{: .filepath} is its entry point

### Explanation
Tricks to help reduce them:
 1. place GTD in BPB;
 2. place SCSI CBW in BPB;
 3. place StandardUsbRequest in BPB.
 4. replace call/ret by inline
 5. manual size optimization
 6. using data created by BIOS after loading bootsector
 7. watch every register

Full search process to find only a specific memory card in the USB2 slot.
Pseoudocode:
```
enumerate pci to find usb/MSD {
	enumerate usb, to find EHCI {
		if ( read from usb, to detect flashstick ) {
			if ( read flashstick to find true signature )
				jump to first readed byte
		}
	}
}
```
