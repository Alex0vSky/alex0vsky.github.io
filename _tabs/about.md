## Networking, 3D, asm

Networking tech from raw posix sockets to boost::asio.

Networking arch is FSM.

Networking grow from Ethernet to Tcp.

3D from simple poligon in VGA to UnrealEngine infrastructure.

Assembler is hooks, is optimization, is obfuscation, is so close to hardware.

I also like physics and higher mathematics. ♥GeoGebra❤.
